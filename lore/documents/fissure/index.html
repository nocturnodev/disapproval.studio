                <strong>Note: </strong>Due to certain redactions ordered to be made by The Government, this article is
                only
                partially<br>

                <strong>Description: </strong>0001 is seemingly a crack made in ██████, thus nicknamed The Fissure, this
                anomalous<br>
                object / phenomenon emits faint noises from inside it. These █████ vary from person to person (refer<br>
                to Addendum-0001-2). It is also to be noted that there are ██ copies all across history on record. How
                they<br>
                manifest is currently unknown. Instances of 0001 slowly dwindle from reality if █████ ████.

                <strong>Addendum-0001-1: </strong>0001 is discovered in an uptown alleyway between ████████ St. and ███
                St.
                by what<br>
                we will now refer as Subject-0001. Subject-0001 is a human male of medium build, 182 cm in height,
                short<br>
                blonde hair and a messy stubble. He is the first recorded human being to be severely affected by
                0001’s<br>
                effects. This has lead to researchers as well as explorers to stay away from 0001 for the time being, as
                this is<br>
                very sporadic behavior.

                <strong>Addendum-0001-2: </strong>The sounds produced by 0001 can be interpreted differently depending
                on
                one’s ████.<br>
                This is demonstrated by Agent ███████ and Dr. ████████. Notably, Agent ████ is unaffected by 0001’s<br>
                anomalous properties. Further investigation is required.
