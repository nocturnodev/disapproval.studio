                <strong>Description: </strong>0002 (V.E.D - <u>V</u>irtual <u>E</u>mulation <u>D</u>evice) a device inquired by The Government with the use of emulating<br>
                the contents and/or the insides of <strong>Graphite Identification 0001</strong>. The device has been minimally tested on ██████, most of<br> which
                were from the █████ █████ of the country. (refer
                to Addendum-0002-2). As of ████.██.██,<br> there are only 2 (two) of these devices on record, The Organization does not
                know how many (if any) are<br>
                currently ██ ███.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Addendum-0001-1: </strong>0002 was created by Dr. ███████ (Hardware) and Dr. ████ (Software);<br>
                both of which have tested 0002 on themselves. However, during Q/A testing, one particular test subject which<br>
                will be referred to as Tester-0001 had a bad experience with the device, reporting minor ████████████<br>
                and █████████ after their time with the device. The reason as to why was never reavealed/found, but there was<br>
                made a medical file, which has been found and publicly published by S. Agent ████████.

                <br>
                <strong>Addendum-0002-2: </strong>.<br>Each tester was given the same amount of time with the device (██ minutes). In this amount of time, the testers managed to<br>
                explore ██km (~█ miles) of <strong>Graphite Identification 0001</strong>'s contents.
